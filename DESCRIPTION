Description: This package implements a general purpose gene set
    analysis method called PADOG that downplays the importance of
    genes that apear often accross the sets of genes to be
    analyzed. The package provides also a benchmark for gene set
    analysis methods in terms of sensitivity and ranking using 24
    public datasets from KEGGdzPathwaysGEO package.

Description: This package implements a general purpose gene set
        analysis method called PADOG that downplays the importance of
        genes that apear often accross the sets of genes to be
        analyzed. The package provides also a benchmark for gene set
        analysis methods in terms of sensitivity and ranking using 24
        public datasets from KEGGdzPathwaysGEO package.
